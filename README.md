# AccStick, ease your computing
=====
We present a tangible computing interface which assist desktop computing with accessibility functions. In order to ease the use of key functions which usually are hidden and hard to find, we provide a physical stick, AccStick, which can be picked and plugged to execute a specific function. Each stick of AccStick is mapped to an accessibility function in the computer including screen magnifier, screen resolution change, display brightness adjustment, cursor size change, and volume control. A user can also bend sticks so that each function is executed with the user's preference. Touch potentiometer and LED strip on dock station provides tactile and intuitive volume control interface.
